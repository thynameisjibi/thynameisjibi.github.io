## Potential Bottlenecks and Specialized Knowledge Requirements

1. **n8n API Integration (High Risk)**
   - Lack of formal documentation will significantly slow development
   - Requires exploratory work in n8n codebase
   - Potential for significant rework as understanding evolves

2. **Canvas Rendering Performance (Medium Risk)**
   - Complex workflow visualization with many nodes may cause performance issues
   - Requires expertise in efficient SVG/Canvas rendering

3. **Drag-and-Drop Field Mapping (Medium Risk)**
   - Complex interaction patterns need precise implementation
   - Coordinating visual feedback with data binding is challenging

4. **State Management Complexity (Medium Risk)**
   - Managing complex workflow state with many interdependent nodes
   - Handling undo/redo functionality for workflow changes

5. **Real-time Updates (Medium Risk)**
   - Implementing efficient execution monitoring
   - Handling potential network interruptions gracefully

## Total Implementation Time

For a frontend developer working independently:

- **Minimum Estimate: 26 weeks (6.5 months)**
- **Realistic Estimate: 32 weeks (8 months)**
- **Maximum Estimate: 36 weeks (9 months)**

With a team of three mid-level developers working collaboratively:
- **Realistic Estimate: 16-20 weeks (4-5 months)** accounting for coordination overhead

## Key Implementation Recommendations

1. **Early n8n API Research**: Begin by deeply understanding the n8n API structure before committing to implementation details

2. **Phased Approach**: Implement core functionality first, then add more complex features

3. **Component-First Development**: Build and test individual components before integrating them into the larger system

4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality and layer in more complex interactions

5. **Regular Performance Testing**: Monitor performance impact with each major feature addition
